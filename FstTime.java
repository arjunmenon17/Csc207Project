//Purpose: To have a timing mechanism that causes months (lasting 5 seconds) and generations (comprising 6 artificial months) to pass, by which the user will be able to tell how much
// and how many generations have elapsed, by which the environment class will know when it may be able to undergo changes, by which the natural selection class is able to determine
// the organisms that may proceed to the next generation and those that do not and by which the organisms class may tell when it may be able to cause mutations in the organisms that
//exist.

//Purpose: To create a class that will cause time, measured in months, to pass at an artificial rate of one month every 5 seconds and to record the passing of months and be
//able to indicate how many months have passed since the program was started. It should also record and indicate the passage of generations, to occur every 6 months in
//program time (30 seconds in real time) which will be used to determine when organisms should be given the opportunity to evolve and when their environment should be given
//the opportunity change.
